Under development plugin for [TiddlyWiki5](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5) that uploads binary tiddlers to external storage and creates _canonical_uri tiddlers in their stead.
Beta release available at https://saqimtiaz.github.io/tw5-file-uploads/

The File Uploads plugin supports multiple pluggable storage backends via uploader modules:

* Fission Webnative
* Github (experimental)
* others hopefully to be added such as Amazon S3, nodejs, Imgur etc.

The plugin itself includes a "dummy" uploader module which implements the interface required of uploader modules but just mocks uploading by logging to the browser developer console.

It is recommended to **disable AutoSave when using this plugin**, to avoid saving imported binary tiddlers twice and using up twice the bandwidth.

The development of this plugin and the uploader modules is being funded via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.comtiddlywikidotorg/projects/tiddlywiki-file-uploadd)
